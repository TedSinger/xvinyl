# xvinyl 
`xvinyl` helps fake a tiling window manager
Call:
`$ xvinyl left`
and the next window over to the left will take focus. Similar with right, up, or down.
I've set keybindings in my desktop environment:
Super+Left -> xvinyl left
Super+Right -> xvinyl right
Super+Down -> xvinyl down
Super+Up -> xvinyl up

This is my first Go project - as I learn more, I will improve the project structure and distribution. Currently, you have to checkout the files and compile yourself.
